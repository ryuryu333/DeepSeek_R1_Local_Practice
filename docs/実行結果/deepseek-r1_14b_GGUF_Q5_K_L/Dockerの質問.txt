<think>
Okay, I need to replace the given Docker commands with a Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup. Let me start by understanding 
what each part of the original commands does.

First, looking at the Docker run commands provided:

1. The first line seems incomplete: `docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.` It's missing the image name, so probably an 
error or oversight.
2. The second command is more complete: `docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama 
ollama/ollama`. This runs the ollama image, mounts the volume `/root/.ollama` to `ollama`, maps port 11434, names it 
'ollama', and uses all GPUs.
3. The third line is another incomplete command: `docker run -d --gpus=all -v`. Again, missing parts.

So, focusing on the second command as the main one to replicate. I need to create a Dockerfile that sets up the environment 
for Ollama and a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the service.

For the Dockerfile:

- The FROM should be `nvidia/driver:535.89.04` because it's using --gpus=all, so it needs an NVIDIA driver.
- ENV CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES can be set to "all" or "auto" for GPU access within the container.
- COPY ollama /ollama would copy the Ollama binary into the container.
- RUN chmod +x /ollama makes the binary executable.
- The CMD should start Ollama with the appropriate arguments, maybe using bash for flexibility.

For Docker Compose:

- Version 3 is standard and compatible.
- Services need to be defined. Here, only 'ollama' service is needed.
- Build context is set so that Dockerfile in the same directory builds the image.
- GPU resources are allocated with `gpus: all`.
- Volumes are specified for mounting as per the original command.
- Port mapping from host 11434 to container 11434.
- Environment variables like NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES might be necessary, set to "all".
- The service is named 'ollama' and started in detached mode.

I should ensure that all volume mounts are correctly specified. Also, the Dockerfile needs to copy any necessary files and 
set up Ollama properly. Since the original command mounts `ollama:/root/.ollama`, I'll replicate that in the compose file 
with a volume mount pointing to `/root/.ollama`.

Potential issues: If the Dockerfile doesn't include starting Ollama, it won't run correctly. So including the CMD line is 
crucial. Also, ensuring the NVIDIA driver version matches what's needed for the Ollama service.

Finally, putting it all together, I'll write out the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml with these considerations.
</think>

To replace the given Docker commands with Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dockerfile** in your project directory:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for Ollama service
FROM nvidia/driver:535.89.04  # Use appropriate NVIDIA driver version

ENV CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="all"

COPY ollama /ollama
RUN chmod +x /ollama

CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "while true; do /ollama serve --listen :11434; done"]
```

2. **Create a docker-compose.yml** file in your project directory:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  ollama:
    build:
      context: .
    gpus: all
    volumes:
      - ollama:/root/.ollama
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    environment:
      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
    name: ollama
    restart: always
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **Dockerfile Setup:**
  - **Base Image:** Uses an NVIDIA driver image to leverage GPU support.
  - **Environment Variable:** `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="all"` ensures all GPUs are accessible.
  - **Binary Copying and Execution:** Copies the Ollama binary and makes it executable. The CMD starts Ollama in a loop to 
keep the container running.

- **Docker Compose Configuration:**
  - **Version:** Uses Docker Compose version 3 for compatibility.
  - **Service Definition:** `ollama` service is defined with GPU allocation, volume mounts, port mappings, and environment 
variables.
  - **Volumes:** Mounts the Ollama data directory as in the original command.
  - **Ports:** Maps port 11434 to allow access from the host machine.
  - **Environment Variables:** Sets `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` for GPU visibility.
  - **Restart Policy:** Ensures the container restarts automatically if it fails.

**Using Docker Compose:**

To start the service, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile and starts the Ollama service with all specified configurations. 
The service will be accessible at `localhost:11434` after starting.

**Stopping the Service:**

To stop and remove the service, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This stops the running container, removes containers, networks, and images related to the compose file.
