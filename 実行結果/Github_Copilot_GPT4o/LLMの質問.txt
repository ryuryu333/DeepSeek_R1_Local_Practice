https://huggingface.co/bartowski/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-GGUF --- --- --- --- --- --- . Each model is quantized in a different way. Please compare the models and narrow down which model will work with my PC's GPU. Then select the model that you think performs better. When thinking about it, please get the information detailed in the URL I just mentioned before you start selecting a model.
